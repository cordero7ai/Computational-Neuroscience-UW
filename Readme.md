# Computational NeuroScience - University of Washington

This respository serves as a companion Journal for the Computational Neusroscience course given by the University of Washington. The actual course offered by Coursera can be found here [https://www.coursera.org/learn/computational-neuroscience](https://www.coursera.org/learn/computational-neuroscience).

## Course Description from the Website

This course provides an introduction to basic computational methods for understanding what nervous systems do and for determining how they function. We will explore the computational principles governing various aspects of vision, sensory-motor control, learning, and memory. Specific topics that will be covered include representation of information by spiking neurons, processing of information in neural networks, and algorithms for adaptation and learning. We will make use of Matlab/Octave/Python demonstrations and exercises to gain a deeper understanding of concepts and methods introduced in the course. The course is primarily aimed at third- or fourth-year undergraduates and beginning graduate students, as well as professionals and distance learners interested in learning how the brain processes information.
